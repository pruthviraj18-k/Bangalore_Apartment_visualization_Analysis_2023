Key objectives of the project included:

Market Analysis: Understanding the distribution of apartment prices across different areas of Bangalore, identifying trends in pricing based on location and apartment sizes.

Geospatial Visualization: Mapping the apartments across Bangalore using geospatial data to visualize their distribution and to provide insights into the most sought-after locations.

The visualization aspect of the project was pivotal, utilizing various Power BI functionalities like interactive dashboards, custom visuals, slicers, and filters to enable users to explore the data dynamically. This provided stakeholders, real estate professionals, and potential buyers/sellers with a user-friendly interface to understand the market dynamics, make informed decisions, and identify investment opportunities.
